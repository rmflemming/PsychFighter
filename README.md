# PsychFighter
2D Fighter ("Street Fighter-esque") video game for experimental purposes. Two fighters with offensive and parry moves. Currently only Player vs AI compatible. Under development.

## Use
The game runs on the LOVE framework (Lua-based 2D game engine). It is necessary to have LOVE installed to run any complete games (.love files), or a lua IDE to work with the code in it's current, incomplete form (e.g. [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/)).
When playing against the AI, files with values pertaining to the AI's behavior timing must be provided. These files are currently included, but if you wish to change the timings, you need to provide different files. There is a matlab file (mkdists.m) provided for making such files. Naturally, this requires matlab. However, these files can be generated by other means.
